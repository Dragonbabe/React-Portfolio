One for current weather, a separate one for UV Index, and then another just for the weather forecast. The user can type in any city and the city will be saved on the page, as well as it will give the user the current weather as well as the 5 day forecast to come. There are also associated icons with each weather type along with it! This was a very fun assignment! I enjoyed working on it and figuring out the little nuances.",

The time had finally come that I would get to see and hear my first live concert.I had never really been to a big concert that had a well-known band. A couple of weeks before the concert I got some information about it, but really didn't think much of it. I talked with some friends about the band and we all casually decided to go get tickets for it. Little did I know what an absolutely spectacular time I would have.As the crowd built up it moved towards the doors that led into the actual theatre. I could see that some type of fog machine was at work. A pale mist came out of the cracks of the door. The inconspicuous sound of music could be heard just over the chatter of the crowd of people. Behind those doors there was a thrilling adventure about to take place.This was my first group project. We designed a website to help fun lovers find entertainment events in their city of choice and be able to express the sentiments of the writer above and his experience at his first live concert!",
